His mother succumbed to a severe fever and died shortly after Alexanderâ€™s 11th birthday. Alexander buried himself in books and obtained a job working as a clerk at a local import-export firm in St. Croix. On August 30, 1772 a devastating hurricane laid waste to the island. Hamilton wrote his father a detailed account of the hurricane that was later published to the Royal Danish-American Gazette. The essay was so well received amongst the community that a fund was collected to send young Hamilton to the North American colonies to receive an education.";
